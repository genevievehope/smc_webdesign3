Traveling throughout the year to pursue the farthest expanses of Earth, Burkard works to capture stories that inspire humans to consider their relationship with nature, while promoting the preservation of wild places everywhere.

                            Layered by outdoor, travel, adventure, surf, and lifestyle subjects, Burkard is known for images that are punctuated by untamed, powerful landscapes. Through social media chris strives to share his vision of wild places with millions of people, and to inspire them to explore for themselves.
                            
                            His visionary perspective has earned him opportunities to work on global, prominent campaigns with Fortune 500 clients, speak on the TED stage, design product lines, educate, and publish a growing collection of books. Along with his team, Burkard is based out of his production studio and art gallery in the Central Coast of California.
                            
                            At the age of 32, Burkard has established himself as a global presence and influencer. He is happiest with his wife Breanne raising their two sons Jeremiah and Forrest in his hometown of Pismo Beach, California.</p>

                <h1>Aleutian Islands</h1>
                <p>Earlier this year, Burkard took his camera to the Alaskan Peninsula, where he spent three days in a twin-engine plane overlooking the remote Aleutian Islands, a string of volcanically active islets that boast some of North America's most spectacular scenery. But beneath the veneer of snow-capped beauty, a troubling trend is at work. Thanks to rising water levels, thawing permafrost and overfishing, many of the islands' 5,000 residents have already been forced to relocate to the mainland — and more could soon follow. As climate change erodes the coastline, reducing and reshaping the landscape, the future of the Aleutian Islands and their inhabitants remains uncertain.</p>

                <h1>Faroe Islands</h1>
                <p>The Faroes’ icy waves and breathtaking scenery were captured by filmmakers Ben Weiland and Chris Burkard in their documentary: Faroes: The Outpost Vol 02, which premiered at the 2015 London Surf Film Festival. Chasing secret beaches and icy waves, they traveled to the Faroe Islands with a team of surfers. But when the weather was stormy, the team had to find other ways to enjoy the landscape. In this shot, surfer Tyler Warren longboards down a wild road, while dark clouds loom in the background.</p>

                <h1>Napali Coast, Kauai</h1>
                <p>The north shore of Kauai features some dramatic and beautiful mountain scenery along with a variety of hidden beaches. The area also has an incredible selection of shopping and dining available for visitors. While the winter months will mean more rain for the northern part of the island, it's still one of the most popular places on the island. Hanalei Bay is a popular location for water activities and has perhaps what are the best beaches in all of Hawaii along with her crescent shores.

                        Kauai's south shore is popular due to its abundance of sunny weather, even during the wet winter months. While Kauai has the small town feel to it, many larger store brands can still be found on the island.</p>
